Here are five coding problems that helped me gain a deeper understanding of pointers using C++:

[**1. Swap Pointers:**](/Pointers/SwapPointers/)
   - A program that swaps the values of two integer pointers.
   - It prompts the user to enter two integers, create pointers to them, and then swap the values using pointers.
   - Finally, prints the swapped values.
   - This problem helps in understand how pointers can be used to indirectly manipulate variables.

[**2. Dynamic Array:**](/Pointers/DynamicArray/)
   - A program that dynamically allocates an array of integers based on user input.
   - Prompts the user to enter the size of the array and allocate memory dynamically using `new`.
   - Fills in the array with user-provided values using pointer arithmetic.
   - Finally, prints the elements of the array.
   - This problem helps in understanding dynamic memory allocation and pointer arithmetic.

[**3. Linked List Operations:**](/Pointers/SingleLinkedList/)
   - Implementation of various operations on a singly linked list using pointers.
   - Functions to insert a node at the beginning, insert a node at the end, delete a node, and display the linked list.
   - Tests the functions by performing operations such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and displaying the final linked list.
   - This problem helps understand how to use pointers to create and manipulate linked data structures.

[**4. Matrix Transpose:**](/Pointers/MatrixTranspose/)
   - Program that transposes a matrix using pointers.
   - Prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns for a matrix, dynamically allocate memory for the matrix using `new`, and fills it with user-provided values.
   - Pointers are used to transpose the matrix in-place, swapping elements based on their positions.
   - Finally, prints the transposed matrix.
   - This problem helps in understandig how to work with multi-dimensional arrays using pointers.

[**5. Circular Queue:**](/Pointers/CircularQueue/)
   - Implementation of a circular queue using an array and pointers.
   - Functions to enqueue elements, dequeue elements, and display the contents of the queue.
   - Tests the functions by performing enqueue and dequeue operations, and display the final state of the queue.
   - This problem helps in understanding how to use pointers to implement data structures with circular behavior.

These problems provide practical hands-on experience with pointers in C++.
