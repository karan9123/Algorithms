Here are five programming problems to practice and better understand classes in C++. Each problem focuses on different aspects of classes and OOP concepts:

[**1. Bank Account:**](/Classes/Bank/)
Create a class `BankAccount` that represents a bank account. It should have data members such as the account number, account holder name, and balance. Implement member functions to deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account details.

[**2. Rectangle and Square:**](/Classes/Shapes/)
Create classes `Rectangle` and `Square` that represent geometric shapes. Both classes should have appropriate data members and member functions to calculate the area and perimeter of the shapes. The `Square` class can be a derived class of `Rectangle`.

[**3. Student Gradebook:**](/Classes/Student/)
Create a class `Student` that represents a student. The class should have data members such as the student's name, roll number, and an array to store their subject grades. Implement member functions to calculate the average grade, display the student's details, and update the grades.

[**4. Library Catalog:**](/Classes/Library/)
Create classes `Book` and `Library` to represent a library catalog. The `Book` class should have data members such as the book title, author, and availability status. The `Library` class should have an array or vector of books and member functions to add books, display available books, and search for a book by title or author.

[**5. Car Rental System:**](/Classes/CarRental/)
Create classes `Car` and `CarRental` to simulate a car rental system. The `Car` class should have data members such as the car's make, model, and rental status. The `CarRental` class should have an array or vector of cars and member functions to rent a car, return a car, and display available cars.

These problems provide a good starting point to practice implementing classes in C++. They cover a range of scenarios where classes can be useful in organizing and managing data.
